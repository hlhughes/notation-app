A.5.2 Text
These commands are used to write text lines within a tune and between tunes. Fonts and
spacing are set with other commands that we will examine later on.
A.5. FORMATTING COMMANDS 105
%%begintext...%%endtext : the pair %%begintext and %%endtext includes a group
of text lines. These lines will be printed. If no text follows %%, the line is a paragraph
separator. For example:
%%begintext
%%Spanish folk song, usually
%%accompanied by guitar and cymbals.
%%endtext
The command %%begintext can be given a parameter to change the text alignment:
%%begintext obeylines prints text as is;
%%begintext fill (or ragged) formats the text to the page margins;
%%begintext justify (or align) as above, but aligns to the page right margin;
%%begintext skip ignores the following lines.
%%center htexti: centers the following text.
%%text htexti: writes the following text. For example:
%%text Spanish folk song
%%textoption hinti: sets the default text option to be used between %%begintext and
%%endtext, or in %%EPS files. The parameter can be a digit or a corresponding string: 0
or obeylines), 1 (justify), 2 (fill), 3 (center), 4 (skip), 5 (right). If the option is
4 (skip), no text or EPS is output.
A.5.3 Fonts
These commands specify the character fonts used in various parts of a score. Please note that
the common True Type fonts used by Windows are not the same fonts used by abcm2ps. In
fact, abcm2ps uses the PostScript fonts, provided for and managed by Ghostscript.
Standard fonts are shown in Appendix A.7. I remind you that indications for adding new fonts
are given in Section 4.5.4.

A.6 abcMIDI commands
Some of these commands will only make sense to advanced users who have some experience
with MIDI files. In a few cases, explanations are taken from the abcguide.txt file included
in the abcMIDI archive.
%%MIDI barlines: turns off %%nobarlines.
%%MIDI bassprog hinti: sets the MIDI instrument for the bass notes in accompaniment
chords to hinti (0–127).
%%MIDI bassvol hinti: sets the velocity (i.e., volume) of the bass notes to hinti (0–127).
%%MIDI beat hint1i hint2i hint3i hint4i: controls the volumes of the notes in a measure.
The first note in a bar has volume hint1i; other “strong” notes have volume hint2i and
all the rest have volume hint3i. These values must be in the range 0–127. The parameter
hint4i determines which notes are “strong”. If the time signature is x/y, then each note
is given a position number k = 0, 1, 2. . . x-1 within each bar. If k is a multiple of hint4i,
then the note is “strong”.
%%MIDI beataccents: reverts to normally emphasised notes. See also %%MIDI nobeataccents.
%%MIDI beatmod hinti: increments the velocities as defined by %%MIDI beat
%%MIDI beatstring hstringi: similar to %%MIDI beat, but indicated with an fmp string.
%%MIDI c hinti: specifies the MIDI pitch which corresponds to C . The default is 60. This
number should normally be a multiple of 12.

(0–127).
%%MIDI chordvol hinti: sets the volume (velocity) of the chord notes to hinti (0–127).
%%MIDI control hbass/chordi hint1 int2i: generates a MIDI control event. If %%control
is followed by hbassi or hchordi, the event apply to the bass or chord channel, otherwise
it will be applied to the melody channel. hint1i is the MIDI control number (0–127) and
hint2i the value (0–127).
%%MIDI deltaloudness hinti: by default, !crescendo! and !dimuendo! modify the
beat variables hvol1i hvol2i hvol3i 15 volume units. This command allows the user to
change this default.

that is, HC3 becomes C6. abc2midi does this by default.
%%MIDI gchordbars hstri: spreads the gchord string over hni consecutive bars of equal
length. The gchord string should be evenly divisible by hni or else the gchords will not
work properly.
%%MIDI gchord hstri: sets up how guitar chords are generated; please see Section 5.1.7.
%%MIDI gchordoff: turns guitar chords off.
%%MIDI gchordon: turns guitar chords on.
%%MIDI grace hfloati: sets the fraction of the next note that grace notes will take up. hfloati
must be a fraction such as 1/6.
%%MIDI gracedivider hinti: sets the grace note length as 1/hintith of the following

two bytes indicates the pitch change. This option is not well documented.
%%MIDI portamento [bass] [chord] hinti: turns on the portamento controller (glide effect)
on the current channel (or to bass/chord channel) and set it to hinti. 0 turns off the
effect.
%%MIDI program [int1] hint2i: selects the program (instrument) hint2i (0–127) for channel
hint1i. If this is not specified, the instrument will apply to the current channel.
%%MIDI randomchordattack: delays the start of chord notes by a random number of
MIDI units.
%%MIDI ratio hint1 int2i: sets the ratio of note lengths in broken rhythm. Normally c>c
will make the first note three times as long as the second; this ratio can be changed with
%%ratio 2 1.
%%MIDI rtranspose hint1i: transposes relatively to a prior %%transpose command by
hint1i semitones; the total transposition will be hint1 + int2i semitones.
%%MIDI snt hinti hfloati: alters the standard MIDI pitch of a note h0–127i; e.g. %%MIDI
snt 60 60.5 alters the pitch of C.
%%MIDI temperament hint1i hint2i: TO BE WRITTEN

hfloat2i specifies in the size of a fifth (normally 700 cents).
%%MIDI temperamentnormal: restores normal temperament.
%%MIDI transpose hint1i: transposes the output by hint1i semitones. hint1i may be positive
or negative.
%%MIDI trim hint1i hint2i: controls the articulation of notes and chords by placing silent
gaps between the notes. The length of these gaps is determined by hint1i/hint2i and the
unit length is specified by the L: command. These gaps are produced by shortening the
notes by the same amount. If the note is already shorter than the specified gap, then the
gap is set to half the length of the note. It is recommended that hint1i/hint2i be a fraction
close to zero. Trimming is disabled inside slurs as indicated by parentheses. Trimming
is disabled by setting hint1i to 0.
